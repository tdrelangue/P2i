## **Project Synthesis**

### **Project Overview**

#### **Academic Context**

This project forms an integral part of the second-year Individual Computing Project at the École Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique (ENSC) in Bordeaux. The core objective of this academic module is to empower students with the development of new skills in both computer science and project management.

Within this academic context, students are entrusted with the responsibility of conceptualizing an idea and proficiently navigating through diverse stages of execution. These stages encompass project management, thorough literature research to identify suitable technological tools, and a substantial programming phase.

#### **Project Focus: Navigating Complexity in Food Industry Order Management**

In the intricate landscape of the food industry, the management of orders is a nuanced task marked by dynamic shifts influenced by market trends, consumer preferences, and seasonal events. The challenges are further intensified by the rigid timelines dictated by product expiration dates (DLC), necessitating a strategic and agile approach.

##### **Strategic Approach**

This project squarely addresses the complexities of food industry order management by adopting a strategic approach focused on adaptability and precision. The core objective is to swiftly respond to production changes while meticulously adhering to the temporal constraints imposed by DLC.

##### **Implementation of Safety Stocks**

At the heart of the strategy lies the implementation of safety stocks as a proactive and pivotal measure. These safety stocks act as resilient buffers, enabling agile responses to unexpected demand fluctuations, a common occurrence in the dynamic and volatile food industry.

##### **Innovative Communication**

To address the communication challenges inherent in this intricate domain, the project introduces innovation. The incorporation of interactive graphical elements serves not only to enhance engagement but also to facilitate knowledge assimilation. This forward-thinking strategy contributes to more effective communication in the complex realm of food industry order management.

### **Software Solution**

The software, divided into two main objectives (Objective A and Objective B), involves developing a user-friendly interface with a graphical representation of potential financial losses and integrating an AI-powered assistant for parameter optimization. Objective A focuses on visualizing risks and ensuring accessibility, while Objective B introduces advanced AI capabilities for optimized stock management decisions.
